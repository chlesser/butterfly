3D sketch with a ton of butterflies flying around!

Enter VR and extend your right handâ€”if you're lucky, a butterfly might land on it.
**Why?** A butterfly once landed on my hand when I felt down, inspiring me to recreate the experience and share these insights: 

# how it works
1. The sprite and the wing flapping technique originate from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4hlSoiR9sc&ab_channel=Miziziziz) by [Miziziziz](https://github.com/Miziziziz)
2. I used the WebXR Hand input to get the position of the hand. I used principles from the [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com) by Daniel Shiffman to translate the states of a butterfly's path and flapping into code.
3. I wanted to put some effort into making a nicer terrain with fog and lighting. I think the forest floor terrain using Quixel assets turned out well!
