![butterflies floating around in 3D](./butterflies.gif)

3D sketch with a ton of butterflies flying around!

The build is actually in `docs`, because of a quirk with how I use GitHub pages to host.

TODO: the flapping kinda glitches out in WebXR / VR, tested in Meta Quest 3. If you have a suggestion for how to fix, please let me know!

The sprite and the wing flapping technique originate from [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4hlSoiR9sc&ab_channel=Miziziziz) by [Miziziziz](https://github.com/Miziziziz)
